# ChessGUI

An graphical application which allows two users to play chess against one another. The application recognises all the standard rules of the game.

Clone the repository, navigate to the root directory, and run

```
javac @javac-options
java @java-options
```

The application will start, and a window will open prompting you to set up a chess game. Configure the game, and press GO! Or if you'd like to find out more about the game, click on INFO.

### Notes

I did this project in high school when I wasn't so mature in the world of programming. The code works, but it is not the best organised, and it does not always follow best practices; nor is it the most efficient or elegant.
