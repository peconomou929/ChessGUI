The application will start, and a window will open prompting you to set up a chess game. Configure the game, and press Go!

### Notes

I did this project in high school when I wasn't so mature in the world of programming. The code works, but it is not the best organised, and it does not always follow best practices; nor is it the most efficient or elegant.
